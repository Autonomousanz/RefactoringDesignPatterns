A wrapper class is a class that encapsulates (or "wraps around") another class, data type, or primitive to provide additional functionality, a different interface, or to adapt the original type to work in a different context.

Key Purposes of Wrapper Classes

Encapsulation: Hiding implementation details of the wrapped type
Adding functionality: Enhancing the original type with additional features
Interface adaptation: Providing a more convenient or specialized interface
Type safety: Adding type checking and validation
Resource management: Handling allocation/deallocation automatically
